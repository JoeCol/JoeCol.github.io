                I am an early career researcher with a doctorate in computer science, with multiple publications and with a strong background working in industry. 
                My research interests include AI, multi-agent systems, AI and law, and robotics. 
                I look towards bringing multiple disciplines together with computer science, with an aim of realising developments into real world applications.
                <br/><br/>
                Currently working with Louise Dennis and Micheal Fisher, I am currently exploring how regulations and ethics can be captured and used to
                verify multi/agent systems such as autonomous cars and UAV's.
