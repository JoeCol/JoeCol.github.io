                An early career researcher with a doctorate in computer science, with multiple publications and witha strong background working in industry.  My research interests include AI, multi-agent systems, AIand law, and robotics.  I look towards bringing multiple disciplines together with computer science,with an aim of realising developments into real world applications.

                Working with Katie Atkinson, I have worked towards building abstract dialectal frameworks whichrepresent the decision making process behind the Article 6 of the European Court of Human Rights,focusing on the admissibility procedure.  The aim of the work is to develop a tool which will enablelawyers to process cases in a more efficient manner using a tool that is able to explain its decisionmaking.
